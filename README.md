# Cryptomatic
Cryptomatic is an app that takes the top 100 Market Cap coins and displays its information accordingly.
The Home displays the general information of the entirety of the Crypto Currency Market.
I've used StoryBoard to create the UI and parses the JSON to display currency, name, market cap, availble coins, and tag name.

Pressing on a coin expands the Crypto Currency information.
